A spreadsheet is a file that contains tabular data – textual and numeric data arranged in rows and columns. A spreadsheet app or program is a software that allows you to manipulate the data in a spreadsheet. The most famous spreadsheet apps today are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. Spreadsheets have a wide range of uses: from basic mathematical calculations to complex business analysis. Budgeting,data visualization via graphs and charts,storing and sorting data,data modelling ,finance planning ,business accounting,inventory management,time tracking,invoicing,surveying,payroll,predictions and simulations,analytical activities (break even analysis, statistical analysis, etc.) and,accumulation of data from different sources are some of the most common uses.

Database Management System (DBMS), on the other hand, is the software system used to create a database and manipulate the data in it. It is an interface that allows users to query data, manage tables, and perform other data operations in the database. Large companies, organizations, municipal departments and other organizations prefer databases to store large volumes of structured data. Therefore, data volume is the main criterion. Other reasons for using a database are easier control and access to your data, logical organization and/or separation of different types of data,calculating and manipulation of large sets of data,access to data for concurrent users,building a dynamic data-driven app and enhanced data protection.

# Advantages of Databeses
Large volume of data
Consistency and integrity of data
Data redundancy control
Shareability and multi-access to data
Data security
Filtering and querying
Scalability
Backup and recovery of data

# Disadvantages of Databases
Steep learning curve
Cost of setup and maintenance
Cost of staff training
Cost of converting data files into a database
Cost of querying

# Advantages of spreadsheet
Free or low cost
Shallow to medium learning curve
Data formatting and visualization
Calculation ability
Preset function for data manipulation
Flexibility

# Disadvantages of spreadsheet
Limited shareability
Security
Poor performance with large volumes of data
Scalability

# Questionnaire
- Do you use a DBMS? If so, which one(s)?
- No, we dont use a DBMS.
- Do you instead store your data in spreadsheets (e.g. Excel)?
- We store our data in Excel.
- Why do you think the use of spreadsheets is important? What is the main benefit to your operation?
- Anyone can add, access, or edit data in Excel. It’s much easier to perform calculations than using other coding languages. Easy to organize data in easy-to-read formats. Also the graphs make it very easy to visualize and organize data. It’s much easier to review calculations in a spreadsheet, at least for the average person.
- What do you think is the main source of trouble in using spreadsheets?
- When the role of data grows and begins to affect the whole scope, spreadsheets fall short. In addition, databases are faster than Excel, which can be one of the main source of trouble in using Spreadsheets.
